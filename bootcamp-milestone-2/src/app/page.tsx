            My name is Mohini, and I am a freshman at Cal Poly SLO! I am majoring
            in Computer Science, which I am <em>so</em> excited about. I was born
            and raised in <strong>Fremont, CA</strong> and some of my favorite
            things to do are go on nature walks/hikes, try new kinds of food,
            play poker, or volleyball!
