          My cousins and I all met up in Cancun during our Winter Break in 2023. 
          It was an awesome trip! I loved jumping into different cenotes, visiting 
          Chichen Itza, taking yacht rides, and swimming in the ocean. The water 
          was so clear and blue! Sadly, I did get salmonella after I got back :(
